    <h3 class="h3">CSS</h3>
    <p class="p1">Text styling is a fundamental aspect of web design, allowing developers to create visually appealing and readable content. In CSS, several properties are available to control the appearance of text, offering flexibility in design and layout. Some of the most commonly used text styling properties include color, font-family, font-size, font-weight, line-height, text-align, text-decoration, text-transform, and letter-spacing.</p><br>
    <p class="p2">The color property sets the text color, which can be defined using named colors, hex codes, RGB, or HSL values. The font-family property allows developers to specify the font to be used. Multiple font families can be listed as fallback options in case the primary font is unavailable.</p><br>
    <p class="p3">Font-size is another essential property, defining the size of the text. It can be set using absolute units like px or relative units like em, rem, and percentages. The font-weight property controls the boldness of the text, with values ranging from 100 (thin) to 900 (extra bold).</p><br>
    <p class="p4">Line-height determines the space between lines of text, enhancing readability. It can be set as a number, percentage, or length value. The text-align property aligns text within its container, with values like left, right, center, and justify.</p><br>
    <p class="p5">Text-decoration adds effects such as underline, overline, or strikethrough to text. The text-transform property controls the capitalization of text, allowing options like uppercase, lowercase, or capitalize.</p><br>
    <p class="p6">Another important property is letter-spacing, which adjusts the space between characters, while word-spacing adjusts the space between words. These properties can significantly impact the overall readability and aesthetic of a webpage.</p><br>
    <p class="p7">In conclusion, CSS text styling properties provide web developers with powerful tools to create visually appealing and readable text. By carefully applying these properties, developers can enhance user experience and convey content in a clear, aesthetically pleasing manner.</p><br>
